# Purpose
- The purpose of this file is to explore the HB1051 data with emphasis on water leakage. The data can be found http://cowaterefficiency.com/unauthenticated_home with permission. Once in the portal, all report years (2013-2017) were selected as well as all water providers.
- Section 1.0 is clean up, section 2.10 is analysis.

- leak2.rmd & leak2.pdf -  The purpose of this file is to explore the HB1051 data with emphasis on water leakage. Files were merged to created water leakage reporting by water provider and year. Data is displayed graphically and recommendations are provided for cleaning up potential reporting errors. The .rmd contains the raw markdown file, the pdf is just a printed version of this.

- ngrams.rmd & n.grams.pdf - The purpose of this file is to conduct text analysis on the leak_detection_field_technology column in the foundational_06a_loss_and_leak_detection file. Distributions of time between testing and age to replace small meters in years are shown. Recommendations for reporting are suggested to leverage this information. The .rmd file contains the raw markdown file, the pdf is just a printed version of this. 


# 1.0 Reading in Data
- The following files were used:
    + overview.csv
    + normalizing_03_population.csv
    + foundational_09_balance_data.csv
  
```{r}

#read in data
overview <- read.csv("EffDataPortal_Output_User690_20181112192716//overview/overview.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

normalizing_pop <- read.csv("EffDataPortal_Output_User690_20181112192716/normalizing/normalizing_03_population.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

foundational_09_balance_data <- read.csv("EffDataPortal_Output_User690_20181112192716/foundational/foundational_09_balance_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

head(overview, n=10)
head(normalizing_pop, n=10)
head(foundational_09_balance_data, n=10)
```


# 1.0 Merging Overview & Normalizing_Pop on ce_annual_ndx & Foundational_09 balance data (to get water provider town name)
- ce_annual_ndx represents the unique water provider that is unique for each provider per year of reporting (which means Denver will have as many ce_annual_ndx numbers as years reported)
- Overview & Normalizing are merged first on ce_annual_ndx, then merged with foundational_09_balance_data on the same variable
- Percentage of Water loss is calculated from the resulting file as calculated_lossS / distributed_watS
- There are about 46 towns where metered water is NA which results in a non-useable percLoss
- Lafayette for 2015, 2016 had no distributed water loss
```{r}
### ce_index is unique for water provider
### ce_annual_ndx is unique for year and provider
joined <- merge(overview, normalizing_pop, by="ce_annual_ndx", all=TRUE)

### remove columns
###
remove <- c("bndss_basin_index", "bndss_type_index", "provider_comments", "report_status", "bndss_id", "pop_served_source", "transient_pop_source", "remark")
joined <- joined[, !(names(joined) %in% remove)]
head(joined, n=10)

### Combine balance data/loss with overview (city & year)
balanceM <- merge(joined, foundational_09_balance_data, by="ce_annual_ndx", all=TRUE)
head(balanceM, n=10)


### calcuate sums of water useage by type (potable, non, etc) by city (indx #)
### calculate percent loss = calculated loss/ distributed wats 

balanceSum <-balanceM %>% group_by(ce_annual_ndx) %>% summarise(distributed_watS = round(sum(distributed_water, na.rm=TRUE), 2), metered_waterS=round(sum(metered_water),3),  calculated_lossS= round(sum(calculated_loss), 2) , percLoss = round(calculated_lossS/distributed_watS,2)) 


### add in descriptor columns
###
c <- c("ce_annual_ndx", "water_provider", "basin", "type", "report_year", "pop_served", "units" )
#colnames(balanceM)

balanceM_short <- balanceM[, (names(balanceM) %in% c)]
together <- merge(balanceSum, balanceM_short, by="ce_annual_ndx")
TotalLossYear <- together[!duplicated(together[,1]),]

# remove all water providers where metered_water is NA
TotalLossYear <- TotalLossYear[!is.na(TotalLossYear$metered_waterS), ]
head(TotalLossYear, n=10)

# remove Lafayette 2015, 2016
TotalLossYear <- TotalLossYear[!TotalLossYear$distributed_watS ==0,]
```
- The following water providers may have errors in reporting because their metered water is much greater than their distributed water. These were removed from the visualizations below
    + Little Thompson - 2014-2017
    + Pueblo - 2013
    + Lafayette - 2013
    + Louisville - 2017
- 31 rows were removed, see excel chart for which water providers and years
